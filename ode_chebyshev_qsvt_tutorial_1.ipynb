    "## 4. Defining Test Matrices and Right-Hand Side Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Instantiate the QSVT helper** and set NumPy’s print options for cleaner output.\n",
    "2. Define several candidate right-hand side vectors $ \\mathbf{b} $ for testing, including:\n",
    "   - We define vector 'b =[0.166667, -0.333333, 0.333333, -0.166667]` that arises after taking the chebyshev transform on the vector 'e = [0, 0, 0, 1]' used in the examples shown.\n",
    "   - Other commented options (e.g. length-4 vectors) that can be activated for different problem sizes.\n",
    "3. Define several candidate matrices $A$, including:\n",
    "   - We take the linear system matrix A, that arises in the Chebyshev Space.\n",
    "   - Other commented options:\n",
    "     - More general diagonal matrices.\n",
    "     - Full 2×2 examples.\n",
    "     - Upper-triangular or more structured 4×4 matrices.\n",
    "4. Implement a **matrix factory** which:\n",
    "   - Takes a desired **condition number** and **matrix type** (e.g. Hermitian positive-definite, Hermitian negative, general complex).\n",
    "   - Constructs a matrix with the requested spectral structure:\n",
    "     - A “MAP TYPE → EIGENVALUES” section that maps the `matrix_type` string to a set of eigenvalues (real or complex) with prescribed sign and magnitude.\n",
    "     - A “BUILD MATRIX” section that generates a random matrix with those eigenvalues via:\n",
    "       - An orthogonal similarity transform for real symmetric (Hermitian) matrices.\n",
    "       - A full similarity transform for general matrices, ensuring the desired eigenvalues.\n",
    "   - Optionally enforces real-valued matrices when the eigenvalues are real.\n",
    "5. Provide an auxiliary function to construct real matrices with a **specified condition number**, using a singular value decomposition-like construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We print the chosen matrix $A$, its condition number, and a separator line.  \n",
    "- In a full Chebyshev-based PDE application, this $A$ would come from the Chebyshev collocation or Galerkin discretization of a differential operator. Here, we use small synthetic examples to verify and benchmark the QSVT solver.\n"

    "We now use QSVT to **solve the linear system** $A \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$. This version is general and works regardless of whether the true solution is complex; it relies on **full access to the circuit’s statevector** or full tomography.\n",

    "## 7. Real-Valued Linear System Solver with Hadamard-Test-Style LCU\n",
    "\n",
    "In many Chebyshev-based differential equation problems, the final solution (e.g., a real-valued field or state) is **real**.  \n",
    "This allows us to avoid expensive full-state tomography and instead extract the solution directly from **measurement statistics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The routine `solve_linear_system_real` builds a measurement-friendly circuit that uses a **Hadamard-test-style Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU)** construction. The key idea is that the **real part** of the QSVT-transformed state can be encoded directly into the probabilities of measurement outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **real part of the solution vector** appears directly in the circuit’s measurement probabilities.\n",
    "- An ancilla-based **LCU construction**—similar to the Hadamard test—is used:\n",
    "  1. Prepare the normalized right-hand-side state $|b\\rangle$ (or its Hermitian-dilation version).\n",

    "     $$\n",
    "     where $U$ is the QSVT circuit approximating $A^{-1}$.\n",
    "  3. Apply a final Hadamard gate to the ancilla, causing constructive and destructive interference that isolates the **real components** of $ U|\\psi\\rangle $.\n",
    "\n",
    "- With the correct control structure, the **measurement probabilities** of computational basis states encode (up to a global normalization) the **squared magnitudes of the real solution components**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important details on extracting the correct amplitudes\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the circuit uses *two kinds of ancillas*—(i) the LCU/Hadamard ancilla and (ii) the block-encoding ancilla—we must restrict attention to the **physically meaningful subspace**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The first (Hadamard-test) ancilla must be measured as `0`.**  \n",
    "   - The state `0` selects the branch that encodes the **real part** of the QSVT-transformed state.  \n",
    "   - The `1` outcome corresponds to the imaginary-component branch and is not used for real-valued systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The last qubit (block-encoding ancilla) must also be measured as `0`.**  \n",
    "   - Block encoding stores the matrix $A^{-1}$ in the **top-left block** of a larger unitary.  \n",
    "   - Measuring this ancilla in `0` projects onto the block that contains the **correct action of the matrix**.  \n",
    "   - Outcomes where the block-encoding ancilla is `1` correspond to “junk subspace” amplitudes and must be discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, **valid measurement outcomes are exactly those bitstrings where:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **first bit = 0**,  \n",
    "- **last bit = 0**,  \n",
    "- and the middle system-qubits encode the vector components.\n",
    "\n",
    "These bitstrings encode the real solution components via their measurement probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reconstructing the real-valued solution from measurement data\n",
    "\n",
    "If a valid computational-basis outcome $x$ (i.e., first bit = 0 and last bit = 0) occurs with measurement probability $p_x$, then the corresponding solution component is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{solution}[x] = \\text{scale\\_factor} \\cdot \\sqrt{p_x}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **square root** arises because probabilities encode **squared amplitudes**.\n",
    "- The `scale_factor`, returned by `solve_linear_system_real`, accounts for:\n",
    "  - normalization of the input vector,\n",
    "  - scaling in the polynomial approximation,\n",
    "  - normalization in the block-encoding,\n",
    "  - normalization in the Hadamard-LCU construction.\n",
