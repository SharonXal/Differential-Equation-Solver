    "# Chebyshev-Based Differential Equation Solving with QSVT\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use **Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT)** as the core engine of a **Chebyshev-based differential equation solver**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall pipeline is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We start from a **differential equation** that is discretized in a **Chebyshev polynomial basis**, yielding a linear system: $Ax = b$\n",
    "- The matrix $A$ encodes the Chebyshev-discretized operator (e.g., a differential operator with boundary conditions).\n",
    "- We implement a **QSVT-based linear system solver** that approximates the inverse function $(f(x) \\approx \\frac{1}{x})$ on the spectrum of a suitably scaled operator.\n",
    "- The method currently performs the **Chebyshev transform** (between physical and Chebyshev coefficient space) **classically** using FFT-based routines (not shown explicitly here). The long-term goal is to replace this step with a **fully quantum Chebyshev transform circuit**, so that the entire pipeline is quantum-native.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **QSVT as a linear system solver.** We implement QSVT for both **scalars** and **matrices**, using a polynomial approximation to $\\frac{1}{x}$ built by **PyQSP**.\n",
    "- **Non-Hermitian support via Hermitian dilation.** General (non-Hermitian) matrices are treated via a Hermitian dilation, allowing us to apply standard QSVT techniques.\n",
    "- **Block encoding via PennyLane.** All quantum logic is written in **Qiskit**, but the block encoding of matrices is delegated to **PennyLane’s `qml.BlockEncode()`**, which provides a single-ancilla block-encoding.\n",
    "- **Phase-convention conversion.** PyQSP returns phases in the **Wx convention**; we convert these phases internally to the **Reflection convention** used by our QSVT implementation.\n",
    "- **Measurement and interpretation.** We show how to interpret the measurement probabilities to recover the normalized solution vector, including the relevant normalization factors.\n",
    "- **Numerical observations.** All tests here are run on a **noiseless `AerSimulator`**, and the QSVT-based solutions match classical solutions with high precision. In practice, we observe that the method remains stable even when the matrix condition number is up to roughly **twice the chosen $\\kappa$** used for phase generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build up the solver in stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate QSVT phases for the function $(f(x) \\approx \\frac{1}{x})$.\n",
    "2. Implement a reusable **QSVT helper class** supporting scalar and matrix inputs.\n",
    "3. Construct test matrices $A$ and right-hand sides $\\ket{b}$.\n",
    "4. Use QSVT to approximate $A^{-1}$ directly.\n",
    "5. Solve linear systems with **full complex amplitudes** (tomography-based readout).\n",
    "6. Solve **real-valued** linear systems using a **Hadamard-test-style LCU construction**, so that the solution can be recovered directly from measurement statistics.\n",
    "7. Conclude with a **roadmap for future work**, including quantum Chebyshev transforms and multi-ancilla block encodings.\n"

    "## 7. Real-Valued Linear System Solver with Hadamard-Test-Style LCU\n",
    "\n",
    "In many Chebyshev-based differential equation problems, the final solution (e.g., a real-valued field or state) is **real**.  \n",
    "This allows us to avoid expensive full-state tomography and instead extract the solution directly from **measurement statistics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The routine `solve_linear_system_real` builds a measurement-friendly circuit that uses a **Hadamard-test-style Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU)** construction. The key idea is that the **real part** of the QSVT-transformed state can be encoded directly into the probabilities of measurement outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **real part of the solution vector** appears directly in the circuit’s measurement probabilities.\n",
    "- An ancilla-based **LCU construction**—similar to the Hadamard test—is used:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Important details on extracting the correct amplitudes\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the circuit uses *two kinds of ancillas*—(i) the LCU/Hadamard ancilla and (ii) the block-encoding ancilla—we must restrict attention to the **physically meaningful subspace**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The first (Hadamard-test) ancilla must be measured as `0`.**  \n",
    "   - The state `0` selects the branch that encodes the **real part** of the QSVT-transformed state.  \n",
    "   - The `1` outcome corresponds to the imaginary-component branch and is not used for real-valued systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The last qubit (block-encoding ancilla) must also be measured as `0`.**  \n",
    "   - Block encoding stores the matrix $A^{-1}$ in the **top-left block** of a larger unitary.  \n",
    "   - Measuring this ancilla in `0` projects onto the block that contains the **correct action of the matrix**.  \n",
    "   - Outcomes where the block-encoding ancilla is `1` correspond to “junk subspace” amplitudes and must be discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, **valid measurement outcomes are exactly those bitstrings where:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **first bit = 0**,  \n",
    "- **last bit = 0**,  \n",
    "- and the middle system-qubits encode the vector components.\n",
    "\n",
    "These bitstrings encode the real solution components via their measurement probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reconstructing the real-valued solution from measurement data\n",
    "\n",
    "If a valid computational-basis outcome $x$ (i.e., first bit = 0 and last bit = 0) occurs with measurement probability $p_x$, then the corresponding solution component is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{solution}[x] = \\text{scale\\_factor} \\cdot \\sqrt{p_x}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **square root** arises because probabilities encode **squared amplitudes**.\n",

    "  - scaling in the polynomial approximation,\n",
    "  - normalization in the block-encoding,\n",
